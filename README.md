Model Building
Multiple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression can easily be extended to include multiple features. This is called multiple linear regression:

y=β0+β1x1+…+βnxn

Each x represents a different feature, and each feature has its own coefficient. In this case:

y=β0+β1×TV+β2×Radio+β3×Newspaper
